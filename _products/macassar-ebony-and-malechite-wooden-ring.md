description: >-
  Malachite is a lush green mineral used since ancient times for both its
  apearance and in the production of copper. Macassar Ebony is a dark coloured
  hardwood which ranges from golden brown to black in hue. This popular design
  is available with either a maple (light coloured) or Mahogany (reddish) wood
  applied to the inside of the ring. Please specify which you would prefer when
  you order.


  Each ring requires several days to produce and is is handmade to order. Orders
  can usually be shipped within one week. Before work can commence you must
  specify your ring size in either the UK or US scale. We normally recommend a
  ring width of 6 to 7 millimeters for smaller sized rings and up to 8
  millimeters wider for larger sizes. Please message us if you would like advice
  on any aspect of sizing or design.
