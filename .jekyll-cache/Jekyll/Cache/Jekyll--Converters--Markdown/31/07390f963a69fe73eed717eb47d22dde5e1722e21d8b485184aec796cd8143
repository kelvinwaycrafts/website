I"»<p>A beautiful and unique wooden ring made from carefully selected materials In our workshop in Scotland. The outer portion of this design consists of Santos Rosewood with a stone  inlay of Lapis Lazuli. An inner layer of wood is made from maple.</p>

<p>Lapis Lazuli is a deep, rich, ocean blue  naturally occuring mineral sourced from the United States, while Santos Rosewood is a hardwood which has a rusty brown hue with dark flecks. Together these provide a stunning contrast quite diffrent from any other ring you will own.</p>

<p>Each ring requires several days to produce and is is handmade to order. Orders can usually be shipped within one week. Before work can commence you must specify your ring size in either the UK or US scale. We normally recommend a ring width of 6 to 7 millimeters for smaller sized rings and up to 8 millimeters wider for larger sizes. Please message us if you would like advice on any aspect of sizing or design.</p>
